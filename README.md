# Deep Learning Fundamentals from Scratch - Google Colab Notebooks
Welcome to the Deep Learning Fundamentals from Scratch repository! This repository contains a series of Google Colab notebooks that cover essential concepts in deep learning implemented from scratch using Python and popular libraries like NumPy.

## Overview
In this repository, you'll find notebooks covering the following topics:

* Introduction to Neural Networks
* Gradient Descent and Backpropagation
* Activation Functions
* Loss Functions
* Regularization Techniques
* Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
* Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
* Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
* Transfer Learning
* Transformers
* Large Language Models
* Reinforcement Learning Basics

Each notebook provides detailed explanations of the concepts along with Python code examples. These notebooks are designed to help you understand deep learning from the ground up, enabling you to build a strong foundation in neural networks and their applications.

## Usage
To get started, simply click on the notebook you're interested in and open it using Google Colab. You can then execute the code cells directly in your browser without needing to set up any environment locally.

Feel free to experiment with the code, modify it, or use it as a reference for your own projects. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please don't hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Requirements
Since these notebooks are hosted on Google Colab, you don't need to install any dependencies locally. Google Colab provides all the necessary libraries and computing resources, allowing you to run the code seamlessly in the cloud.

## Contribution
Contributions to this repository are highly appreciated! If you'd like to contribute, you can:

Add additional notebooks covering more deep learning concepts
Improve existing notebooks by providing clearer explanations or optimizing the code
Fix bugs or errors in the code
Provide translations or additional resources
Please follow the contribution guidelines outlined in the repository and maintain coding standards when submitting a pull request.

## License
